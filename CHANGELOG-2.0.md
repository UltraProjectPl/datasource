# Changelog for version 2.0

This is a list of changes done in version 2.0.

## Deleted Symfony extension

Since it was moved to [datasource-bundle](https://github.com/fsi-open/datasource-bundle),
it has been removed from this component.

## Dropped support for PHP below 7.1

To be able to fully utilize new functionality introduced in 7.1, we have decided
to only support PHP versions equal or higher to it.
